# Raw Idea: Canvas Analytics Insights

**Feature Name:** Canvas Analytics Insights

**Description:**
Add real-time analytics and insights directly on the funnel canvas to help users understand their funnel performance at a glance. This includes 5 enhancement areas:

1. **Per-Node Revenue Badge** - Display revenue contribution on each node
2. **Traffic Flow Indicators** - Show visitor counts on edges/connections between nodes
3. **Node Health Indicators** - Color-coded performance indicators (green/yellow/red) based on conversion rates and revenue contribution
4. **What-If Sensitivity Markers** - Show impact potential ("1% conversion bump = +$X")
5. **Breakeven Indicator** - Add breakeven calculations to the metrics panel

All enhancements leverage existing calculation data from funnelCalculations.ts and display it visually on the canvas and nodes.
