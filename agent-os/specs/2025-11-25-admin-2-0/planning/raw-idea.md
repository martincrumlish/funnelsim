**Feature Description:**

Admin 2.0 - Key admin features are missing and need to be added:

1. **Products Management**
   - Add Product function
   - Delete Product function
   - Done correctly with Supabase and proper roles/RLS

2. **Users Management**
   - Edit user functionality
   - Delete user functionality

3. **Admin Settings - Logo Upload**
   - Currently has URL fields for logos
   - Need to also allow image upload
   - Tell user recommended sizes

4. **Admin Settings - Form-based Content Editors**
   - Features section currently has manual JSON edit (too hard for regular users)
   - Replace with a form: pick an icon, add title, add description
   - Same/similar approach for Testimonials
